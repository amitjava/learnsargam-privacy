        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

        <h3>Microphone Access</h3>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>Important - Audio Data Handling:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>All audio processing happens locally on your device in real-time</li>
                <li>We do NOT record, store, or transmit any audio data to external servers</li>
                <li>No voice recordings are saved anywhere</li>
                <li>Audio data is processed instantly and discarded immediately after pitch detection</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Local Storage</h3>
        <p>The App stores the following data locally on your device:</p>

        </ul>

            <li>Uninstalling the application</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once deleted, this data cannot be recovered as we do not maintain any copies on external servers.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have full control over your data:</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is suitable for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age.

            <li><strong>Consent:</strong> By granting microphone permission, you consent to real-time audio processing for pitch detection</li>
        </ul>
